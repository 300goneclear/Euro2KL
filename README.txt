This build is configured for GitHub project pages with data under:
  /Euro2KL/assets/data

Files the pages request:
  /Euro2KL/assets/data/players.json
  /Euro2KL/assets/data/team_stats.json  (or players.json used to aggregate)
  /Euro2KL/assets/data/teams.json       (optional, for pretty team names)

If you ever move the folder, open stats.js and change DATA_BASES accordingly.
